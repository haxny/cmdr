/**
 * Focus watchdog: logs a WARN when the main window has OS focus but focus sits
 * in no keyboard home (neither file pane nor the Ask Cmdr rail) for
 * {@link WAIT_MS}+ ms, with no dialog open.
 *
 * Catches a class of bug where a modal or palette closes without restoring
 * focus to the previously focused pane. Arrow keys then silently no-op
 * because they go to `<body>`. The user just sees "keyboard nav broken"
 * with no obvious trigger; this logs the offending `activeElement` and the
 * likely cause (what last had focus, and whether it left the page, got
 * disabled, or lost it to a click on something unfocusable) so we can trace
 * it back to the component that should have kept or restored focus.
 *
 * Event-driven, no polling: `focusin`/`focusout` on document plus
 * `focus`/`blur` on window. Cost is a handful of listeners + at most one
 * timer (only while focus is misplaced). Warns at most once per "lost
 * focus episode"; resets when a pane regains focus.
