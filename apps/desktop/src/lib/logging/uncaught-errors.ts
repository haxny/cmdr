/**
 * Forwards uncaught frontend errors into the app log, so a crash in the webview
 * leaves a trace instead of dying in a console nobody reads.
 *
 * Without this, an uncaught throw or an unhandled promise rejection is invisible
 * everywhere that matters: no line in the Rust log, nothing in an error-report
 * bundle, nothing in a CI E2E run's output. A two-hour CI wedge where the panes
 * stopped listing while the rest of the app stayed healthy produced zero frontend
 * evidence for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Registered once from `routes/+layout.ts` (a stable module, like
 * `hmr-recovery.ts`) so the listeners survive layout re-evaluation during HMR.
 * `log.error` is forwarded to Rust in production too — the prod sinks carry
 * `error+` — so these land in the log file and in error-report bundles.

 * `detail="…"` field: an error report redacts and caps it, because an error message can quote a

 * minified offsets — which is exactly what a Svelte flush throw in the servers hub looked like,
 * and it cost a real diagnosis. (verified on macOS 26.6.2 / WKWebView and Linux WebKitGTK,
