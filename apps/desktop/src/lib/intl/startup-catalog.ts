/**
 * The catalog a new window most likely speaks: the one the last language switch, in any window,
 * landed on. The message runtime loads it, and speaks it, before the window's first render, so a
 * language picked against the OS shows from the first frame instead of after the setting applies.
 *
 * Every Cmdr window shares the `tauri://localhost` origin, so one window's switch informs the next
 * window and the next launch. A hint only: the `appearance.language` setting stays the truth, and
 * a stale hint (the macOS language changed while Cmdr was closed) costs one more catalog load when
 * the setting applies.
 *
 * Its own module, with no imports, so `test-setup.ts` can forget the hint BEFORE the runtime reads
 * it: Vitest keeps localStorage across files and runs.
