/**
 * DOM focus and `aria-activedescendant` for a file list (`BriefList`, `FullList`).
 *
 * The focused pane's listbox holds DOM focus and names its cursor row through
 * `aria-activedescendant`; focus never sits on a row (rows unmount under virtualization, and
 * focus on a removed node drops to `<body>`). The id lands one frame after the listbox takes
 * focus, and again one frame after the cursor row's node is replaced under it, both through
 * `#lib/ui/deferred-active-descendant.svelte.ts`, where the VoiceOver evidence lives.
 *
 * The listbox reports focus from its own `focus` / `blur` events, so every path in counts:
 * `focusList`, a click (the browser's mousedown default), the explorer's focus guard. It
 * also re-homes focus when it mounts or unmounts (below), through `#lib/ui/focus-restore.ts`.

  // the id lands again a frame later. A plain cursor move changes the id and shows at once.
  //
  // ❗ A navigation can also strand focus without remounting the list: Backspace on a focused
  // path segment goes up and unmounts that segment (it turns into the current folder's plain
  // text), so focus falls to `<body>`. The new folder's cursor row picks it up (its own
