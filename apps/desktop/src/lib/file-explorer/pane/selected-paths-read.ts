/**
 * The focused pane's SELECTION as paths, for the copy-path / copy-filename
 * commands (Finder's ⌥⌘C "Copy as Pathname" and Total Commander's "Copy names
 * with full path" act on every selected item, so ours do too).
 *
 * ❗ The selected indices are read through `readPressedRows`: revision checked
 * against the pane's applied sequence, waiting out a busy folder, and re-read
 * from the pane on each attempt. A watcher insert renumbers rows, and copying
 * the paths of whatever now sits at the old indices would put the wrong files
 * on the clipboard. Rows that never settle are refused (`changed`), never
 * reinterpreted, the same answer F5/F6 gives (`transfer-operations.ts`).
 *
 * The rows' own `path` is what lands on the clipboard, exactly what the
 * single-entry `getPathToCopyUnderCursor` reads off the cursor row, so archive,
 * S3, SFTP, and phone panes copy the same kind of path for N rows as for one.
