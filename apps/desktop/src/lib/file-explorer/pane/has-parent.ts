 * Pure helpers for `FilePane.svelte`'s `hasParent` derivation.
 *
 * The snapshot rule comes in as the `hasParentRow` capability
 * (`VolumeCapabilities.hasParentRow`, `false` for the search-results kind), NOT
 * a `volumeId === 'search-results'` string compare. A snapshot
 * pane has no `..` row, and the path comparison `currentPath !==
 * effectiveVolumeRoot` can't catch it — a `search-results://sr-N` URL never
 * matches a real volume root, so without `hasParentRow` the comparison returns
 * `true` and `selection.selectAll(hasParent, ...)` then skips index 0 (the
 * off-by-one pinned by the regression test).
 *
 * `hasParentRow` folds ONLY the snapshot rule; it is NOT a complete has-parent
 * answer. The two PATH comparisons stay here: a `local` pane at `/`, or any pane
 * sitting on its volume root, has no `..` despite `hasParentRow: true`. The real
 * answer is `hasParentRow && currentPath !== '/' && currentPath !== root`.

 * `Browse snapshots` folder, a `.git`), but the pane sits on the PARENT drive (the
 * tab keeps its id), and the container's top folder has a parent. So the drive's
