//! The app's half of the listing engine's tests: each adapter against the real
//! subsystem it answers from, and the cells whose point is an app piece (the
//! FSEvents watch, the volume registry's routing, a backend crate, the events
//! policy). The engine's own cells build an engine of their own, in
//! `file_system/listing/`.
//!
//! These share the test binary's ONE engine (`listing_host::listings()`) unless
//! a cell builds its own, so they keep unique ids (`TestListing` derives one).
