//! Which server each SMB share is on: recording the GUID a direct session's
//! NEGOTIATE answered, and probing the saved shares that never had one.
//!
//! The GUID is what proves two saved shares (one NAS by its LAN and its Tailscale
//! address) are one share (`location::same_share`). Two writers, two strengths
//! (`server_guid::GuidProof`):
//!
//! - **A direct session comes up** ([`record_session_guid`], from both
//!   `smb_upgrade` install paths): the session's GUID goes onto the share's saved
//!   row, overwriting when it signed in as an account, filling only for a guest.
//!   A live share with no saved row keeps it here in memory, and a row saved later
//!   adopts it ([`adopt_live_guid`]).
//! - **The background probe** ([`schedule_probe`]): a NEGOTIATE-only dial of a
//!   saved address, no credentials, for rows saved before Cmdr kept GUIDs. Runs
//!   only when two or more share rows a mount went through share a share name
//!   and one lacks a GUID (never a host nobody connected), one pass at a time, each dial bounded by [`PROBE_TIMEOUT`], and only ever
//!   FILLS. ❌ Never from a tool handler: a model's read must not dial a host
//!   (pinned by `probe_tests::no_tool_handler_reaches_the_probe`).
