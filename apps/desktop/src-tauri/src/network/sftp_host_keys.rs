//! The app's answer to a backend's "have we met this server before?" question.
//!
//! SSH trust is trust-on-first-use: the security of every later connection rests
//! on recognizing the same host key next time. A backend can't own that store —
//! it outlives any one volume, it's the user's to inspect and clear, and writing
//! it durably is the app's business — so it arrives through
//! `cmdr_fs::volume::host::host_keys::HostKeys` and this is what the app
//! installs.
//!
//! ❗ **A new store rather than a widened `KnownNetworkShare`.** That type's
//! `share_name` and its guest-versus-credentials `AuthOptions` can't express key
//! or agent auth, and a host key isn't a share at all.
//!
//! ❌ **Nothing here writes `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.** The backend reads that file
//! as a fallback so a server the user's terminal already reaches doesn't ask
//! again, but it belongs to `ssh`, and a file manager appending to it is a
//! surprise nobody asked for.
