//! NFS volume wiring: turns "the user asked for this export" into a registered
//! `NfsVolume`.
//!
//! ❗ **A backend never registers itself.** The same shape as
//! `s3_volume_wiring`: dial, register (retiring any predecessor), and remember
//! the place for next time, in that order. The rule:
//! `network/DETAILS.md` § "Backends never register themselves".
//!
//! ❗ **The id comes from what the dial RESOLVED, ❌ never from what was typed.**
//! `cmdr_nfs::connect_nfs_volume` splits a typed `/share/Public/photos` into the
//! export and a folder under it, so this registers under the returned volume's
//! id and saves its params (the real export, the rest as the start folder).
//!
//! No secret anywhere: `AUTH_SYS` sends a uid and a gid, which are settings of
//! the place in `nfs_known_places.rs`.
