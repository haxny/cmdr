//! Approving a server proposal: the user's click on a server card, saved through the servers
//! hub's own cores, or given back with the reason.
//!
//! [`approve_server`] runs, in order: the claim (the store's, one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, the revision
//! as its binding); the anti-spoofing checks again against what's saved NOW (an add saved since,
//! a name taken since, an edited server changed since); one save through a [`ServerSaver`]; then
//! the group's end by what the save says. Only a save that wrote NOTHING gives the claim back:
//! anything that may have written ends `completed`, or stays `approved` for the next launch to
//! call `interrupted`, so no second click can write twice. Why: `../DETAILS.md` § Approving a
//! server.
//!
//! ❌ The `main.db` write transaction is never held across the save: the claim commits, the save
//! runs, then the completion writes.
