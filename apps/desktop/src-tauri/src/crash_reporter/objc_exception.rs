//! Keeps the name and reason of an uncaught Objective-C exception for the crash report.
//!
//! An Objective-C exception that nothing catches ends in `abort()`, which our signal handler sees
//! as a bare SIGABRT. Neither our raw file nor macOS's `.ips` says WHY: macOS 27 writes only
//! `"asi": {"libsystem_c.dylib": ["abort() called"]}` (verified on macOS 27.0 with a throwing
//! `NSFilePromiseProvider`, 2026-10-13). CRASH-K35S2 shipped exactly that, and the one line that
//! would have named the bad input was lost.
//!
//! `_objc_terminate` calls the uncaught-exception handler before it aborts, so that's where we
//! read it. The handler runs on the throwing thread in an ordinary (not signal) context, so it may
//! allocate and write a file. It writes `<name>: <reason>` to a sidecar next to the raw crash
//! file, chains to whatever handler was installed before ours, and returns so the abort and the
//! SIGABRT handler run as before. The next launch folds the line into the report's
//! `panic_message`, where `prepare_for_delivery` redacts and caps it like any panic payload: the
//! reason is free text from AppKit and can quote a file name or path.
