# Listing index sizes: details

## Flow

1. The drive index commits a batch and emits `IndexEvent::DirsUpdated { paths }` through its event sink.
2. `events/index_mapping.rs` routes it here (`dirs_updated`) instead of to the frontend, and reports
   `Destination::ListingIndexSizes`.
3. The worker matches the batch against every open listing (`touched`) and merges what it touched into that listing's
   pending set.
4. A listing refreshes when its pending set is non-empty, its last refresh is at least `COOLDOWN` (2 s) ago, and the main
   window is visible. A listing inside its cooldown gets a deadline, so the last change always lands (leading plus
   trailing).
   A listing also rereads the rows a reading said would flip their hourglass on their own (`schedule.rs` rechecks), at
   that moment and outside the cooldown.
5. The refresh (on the blocking pool) reads the touched rows' `dir_stats` plus the listing's own, keeps the rows whose
   `RowSizes` moved, writes them into `LISTING_CACHE`, and emits `listing-index-sizes-changed` with their readings and,
   when it moved, the listing's own reading (the `..` row). Nothing moved: nothing is sent.
6. The frontend (`src/lib/file-explorer/pane/index-events.ts` → `FilePane.applyIndexSizes`) writes the readings onto
   its cached rows and the cursor entry in place, re-reads only the status-bar totals, and pushes the MCP pane state.

A whole-volume batch (`Touched::Whole`) skips the per-row comparison: it runs the full `refresh_listing_index_sizes`
re-enrich and sends `full: true`, and the pane re-reads its window's sizes the old way. It happens once per scan.

The open-listing set is kept by a `ListingLifecycle` observer (`crate::listing_lifecycle`), registered from setup via
`start`. It reads the listing's volume id and path off the `CachedListing` record, which the open path inserts before it
notifies.

## The batch shapes

- **A live batch**: each changed directory plus its whole ancestor chain up to `/`
  (`cmdr-index` `paths::path_prefix::with_ancestor_closure`). About once a second on a busy disk.
- **A network or phone watcher's batch**: only the changed directory's parent, no chain (`transports/smb/watch.rs`,
  `transports/mtp/watch.rs`). `touched` finds the child row on the way down all the same.
- **Whole-volume moments**: `["/"]` after a full scan completes or a replay overflows, `[volume_id]` after a network
  scan completes, `[volume_root]` after a phased first index completes. The last one is handled by the frontend's
  `index-aggregation-complete` refresh, which fires in the same breath.

## Decisions

**Decision**: the backend decides which listings and rows an update touched, and whether anything shown moved. **Why**:
the frontend used to get every batch and match paths itself. Its `/` short-circuit fired on every live batch (they all
end in `/`), so both panes refreshed on every write anywhere on the disk, each refresh six IPC calls whether or not a
number moved: about 110 refreshes per three idle minutes on a pane on `~`, which made the WebContent process idle at
~1.4% of a core instead of ~0.2% (measured 2026-09-23, dev build, issue #92). The backend already knows every open
listing, and it has to read the stats anyway, so it's also where "did anything change" is cheapest to answer.

**Decision**: compare raw readings, not formatted text. **Why**: the size text depends on settings and locale the
webview owns (units, separators), and the tooltip shows exact counts. A raw change that formats the same still reaches
the pane, where Svelte leaves the DOM alone because the text is equal, and the Full list holds the Size column's width
(`views/measure-column-widths.ts::holdSizeColumnWidth`).

**Decision**: hold everything while the main window is hidden and catch up on show. **Why**: nobody reads a hidden
pane, and WebKit queues the DOM work anyway (the diagnosis saw transitions piling up in a hidden page). The catch-up is
one refresh per listing with every batch merged. The cost: the listing cache's sizes (and so MCP's) are stale while the
window is hidden, by at most what changed in that time.

**Decision**: the hourglass's two-second delay lives in the index, and this worker only follows it. **Why**: the webview
also reads `DirStats` directly (a window fill, the cursor entry), and so does the agent's `list_dir`. A delay kept here
would leave those readers showing the raw flag, and the `lit` set would disagree with what a row on screen wears. The
index answers every reader the same, and tells this worker when a row flips (`recursive_size_pending_changes_in`, plus a
`DirsUpdated` for the folders whose shown hourglass a drain ended). A recheck runs at its moment, outside the cooldown:
waiting would show the hourglass up to two seconds late, or never for a short one the webview already read. It rereads
only the flipping rows and sends only what moved, so under churn it costs an index read, not an event.

## Calculating sizes on demand (count.rs)

Total Commander's ⌥⇧⏎ ("count the space subfolders occupy") and Space on a folder. The index answers the volumes it
covers; `count.rs` walks what it can't (SFTP, WebDAV, S3, archives, a folder the index excludes).

- **Walks through `Volume::scan_for_copy_batch_with_boundary`**, the copy dialog's cancellable scan, so every backend
  that supports copying supports this, with its batching and its stop. The volume is `manager.resolve`d like a copy
  source, so an archive or `.git` route walks its own tree.
- **Readings travel the index's road**: written into `LISTING_CACHE` (`update_index_sizes_by_path`), then sent as
  `listing-index-sizes-changed`. A walk longer than 250 ms sends its running total as a lower bound
  (`recursive_size_complete: false`) with the hourglass; a finished one is exact. A short walk sends only its exact size,
  so nothing flashes "≥ 0". The frontend has no new row path.
- **Decision: on an indexed volume the index keeps its rows.** Only a folder it says nothing about (no size at all) is
  walked; one it's still completing (a lower bound) is left to it. Why: the worker re-sends its own readings for rows it
  covers, and two writers on one row overwrite each other's size and hourglass. Elsewhere every folder without an exact
  size is walked; Space recounts its folder.
- **One count per listing**, registered before any await, so Esc during the volume resolve has something to stop. A
  newer count SUPERSEDES the older, which then writes nothing more (its "stopped" reading would land over the newer
  one's). Esc (`cancel_folder_size_count`) keeps what was counted as a lower bound without the hourglass. Closing the
  listing cancels its count (`listing_closed`), and a walk that finds its listing gone stops itself.
- **A folder it can't read gets back what it showed before** (sent as a `full` event, since "no size" isn't a reading
  an event can carry); the rest still get counted. `counted` only counts folders the pane still shows.
- **Not persisted**: a refresh that re-reads the folder drops the readings, as Total Commander's does.
