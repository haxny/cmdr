//! The macOS half of a pane's watch: one FSEvents stream per listing, through our
//! vendored `cmdr-fsevent-stream` (the indexer's FSEvents layer too).
//!
//! Why not `notify`: its FSEvents callback keeps an event only when its path
//! `starts_with` the watched folder, so a `MustScanSubDirs` / dropped-events signal
//! anchored at an ANCESTOR (as high as `/`) never reached us, and the pane never
//! learned it had lost history. Here every event reaches [`classify`], which keeps
//! what `notify`'s non-recursive filter kept (the root and its direct children)
//! plus any rescan anchored at or above the root. `file_system/DETAILS.md` § "Lost history".
