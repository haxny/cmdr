//! Which side a failure deep in a folder transfer is reported against.
//!
//! cmdr-reports#62 (`ERR-UK5NH`): a local folder moved onto an SMB share, and
//! the share refused to create a NESTED folder (`STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`). The
//! walker labelled that refusal with the SOURCE item it was on, so the dialog
//! used source-side move wording and told the user to unlock their intact local
//! folder in Finder. The refusal was the destination's, and so is the path the
//! user needs to see.
//!
//! The rule these cells pin, for the serial copy, the concurrent copy, and the
//! cross-volume move: a refusal from the DESTINATION (a nested mkdir, a file
//! write, the landing rename) is reported as the destination's, at the
//! destination path; a refusal from the SOURCE (opening a file, reading it) is
//! still the source's, at the source path, which is what cmdr-reports#17 needs
//! (`move_failure_tests.rs::cross_volume_move_that_cannot_remove_the_original_says_the_copy_landed`).
//!
//! The source lives at `/tN/...` and the destination at `/inbox/tN/...`, so the
//! reported path alone tells the two sides apart.
