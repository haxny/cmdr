//! The arena: one compact node per selected entry, folder aggregates, and the
//! per-file-boundary mutations the drivers report through.
//!
//! Layout (the 64 B/node budget in `DETAILS.md` rests on it):
//! - Nodes sit in BREADTH-FIRST order, assigned once by the builder, so every
//!   folder's scanned children are one contiguous id range in tree order. A
//!   child's position is `id - first_child`, a child is `first_child + i`, and no
//!   per-node child list exists at all.
//! - A child discovered after the scan (a file that appeared mid-copy, or the
//!   contents of an opaque folder) is appended to the arena and listed in
//!   `extra_children`, after its parent's scanned children.
//! - Names live in one shared `String`; a node holds an offset and a length.
//! - A file's size and a folder's aggregate live in side vectors, reached
//!   through the node's `slot`.
