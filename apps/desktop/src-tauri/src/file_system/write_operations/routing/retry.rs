//! How a failed transfer starts again: the queue window's Retry on a "Couldn't
//! finish" row.
//!
//! A background job has no dialog holding its birth context the way the
//! foreground error dialog does (`dialog-state.svelte.ts::retryPropsFrom`), and
//! the queue window is a separate webview that never saw how the job began. So
//! the BACKEND keeps the recipe: the start's own arguments, captured at the one
//! routing entry every cross-volume copy and move goes through
//! (`super::start_volume_copy` / `super::start_volume_move`), held with the
//! operation by the manager (as a `manager::StartAgain`, so the manager never
//! reaches back into the routing it would re-enter), and carried onto its
//! retained failure.
//!
//! **A retry is a NEW operation**, with the same sources, destination, and
//! conflict policy, and four things reset, the same four the foreground's
//! `retryPropsFrom` resets (❗ keep the two in step):
//!
//! - **No preview**: the backend refuses a second claim on one preview, and the
//!   retry runs its own scan.
//! - **No pre-known conflicts**: the failed run may have landed files, so the
//!   old pre-flight's list is stale; the backend finds conflicts itself.
//! - **The initiator is the user**: the click is theirs, whoever started the
//!   original (an agent, a drag).
//! - **No source binding**: the binding is a promise to whoever started the
//!   original (`source_binding.rs`), and the person clicking Retry is looking at
//!   the row, not at that promise.
//!
//! Everything else a start does, the retry does too, because it IS a start: it
//! queues behind a busy lane like any operation, and one that waited checks its
//! sources when admitted and asks "move the rest / cancel" about any that left
//! meanwhile (`../queued_sources.rs`). One admitted at once is a fresh start the
//! person just asked for, so a source gone by then fails it with its own typed
//! error, exactly as a new copy of that file would.
