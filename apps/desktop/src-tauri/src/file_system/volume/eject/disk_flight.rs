//! Cmdr's own eject of a PHYSICAL disk's volumes: one flight per disk at a time, every
//! volume it takes down gated and stopped before anything unmounts, and everything it
//! stopped handed back when a volume stays.
//!
//! **Why per disk.** `diskutil eject` of one volume takes the whole disk down, so a
//! sibling partition or APFS volume Cmdr indexes would meet the unmount with a live
//! FSEvents watcher on it, which is the FSKit wedge the pre-stop exists to avoid. And
//! a disk that refuses because a sibling is held used to read as a clean eject
//! (`real_image.rs` pinned it), leaving the drive powered on. One volume of a disk that
//! keeps others takes `diskutil unmount` instead (`disk_reach`), with only that volume
//! stopped.
//!
//! The order is the one in `volume/DETAILS.md` § "Eject": resolve the disk, decide how
//! far the eject reaches, capture what it takes down, adopt that into the ejecting set,
//! the busy gate, one release under one deadline, the pre-check when several volumes are
//! going, the teardown, then the resume. ❌ Nothing unmounts after a step before it
//! stalled or refused.
