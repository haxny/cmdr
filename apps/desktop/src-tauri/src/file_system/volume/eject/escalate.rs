//! Taking down an SMB mount that may be DEAD: a normal unmount first, and a force
//! unmount only when that one didn't answer.
//!
//! The one caller is "Eject and save" on an SMB host's address move
//! (`server_move_smb.rs`): a NAS that got a new IP leaves its old-address mounts dead,
//! and a normal unmount of a dead SMB mount hangs.
//!
//! ❗ **Force only on no answer, ❌ never on a refusal.** A refused unmount
//! ([`EjectError::UnmountRefused`]) means something has files open there: the mount is
//! LIVE, and forcing it could lose someone's unsaved work in another app. A dead mount
//! loses nothing to a force. Every other answer stops too: a stalled pre-unmount step
//! (`NotResponding`) never reached the unmount, so forcing past it would skip the index
//! stop the wedge guard needs. `volume/DETAILS.md` § "Eject" has the why.
