//! Filling in the files-changed counts the `.git/commits/` walk leaves out.
//!
//! The walk lists every commit `CountPending` (`cmdr_git::GitPortal::commit_rows_with_counts`
//! is the other half), so the list and its total show at once. Then:
//!
//! - **A listing of at most `GitPortal::COUNT_ALL_LIMIT` commits is counted in full**
//!   ([`count_all`]), in the background, a batch at a time, so the cells fill and a
//!   Size sort settles as it goes. That's what makes Size sort work there.
//! - **A longer one is counted only where a pane looks** ([`fill`]), and Size sort
//!   isn't offered: the pane learns that from [`CommitCountPass::TooMany`].
//!
//! Counted rows are patched into the listing as `DirectoryChange::Modified`, so they
//! re-sort and stay counted. They go to the listing engine alone, ❌ never
//! `listing_host::directory_changed`, which would also hand virtual git rows to the
//! file index.
