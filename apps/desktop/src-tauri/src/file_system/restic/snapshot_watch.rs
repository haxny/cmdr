//! Keeps an open `Browse snapshots` pane showing new backups (#626).
//!
//! The view is unwatchable (`ResticVolume::can_watch_listings` is false: its
//! paths aren't on any disk), but the repo's real `snapshots/` folder is, and a
//! restic backup writes its snapshot file there LAST, after its data and index.
//! So while a pane shows a repo's snapshots root, this watches that folder on
//! the PARENT and re-lists the pane when a file appears or goes. The re-list is
//! the same one a manual refresh runs: the hub reads `snapshots/` again (only
//! the new files) and rebinds `latest` under its own rules.
//!
//! Two sources, one per kind of parent:
//!
//! - **A parent `notify` can watch** (`can_watch_listings`: the local disk and
//!   OS-mounted shares) gets a stream of ours on `<repo>/snapshots`. On an
//!   OS-mounted share FSEvents sees only this Mac's writes, so a backup another
//!   machine makes shows on the next refresh.
//! - **A parent with its own watcher** reports the change through the host's
//!   composer, which calls [`directory_changed`]: a direct SMB share's
//!   CHANGE_NOTIFY covers the whole share. Nothing of ours to arm.
//!
//! Every other parent (SFTP, WebDAV, S3, a phone) reports nothing, so its pane
//! shows a new backup on the next manual refresh. ❌ No polling.
//!
//! Arming follows the LISTING, the git portal's shape (`git/arming.rs`): the
//! observer takes a hold on the repo when a root listing opens and gives it back
//! when it closes; the last hold stops the stream.
