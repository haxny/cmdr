//! The `Browse snapshots` row that joins a restic repo's real listing.
//!
//! Everything at and below `<repo>/Browse snapshots` is a routed volume
//! (`cmdr_restic::ResticVolume`). The repo folder itself can't be: its real
//! files (`config`, `data/`, …) must stay ordinary files, listable, copyable,
//! and deletable. So the row reaches the pane as a [`ListingOverlay`]
//! contribution instead, and no walker ever sees it.
//! `volume/DETAILS.md` § "Architecture".
