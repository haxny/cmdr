//! Whether the running `.app` bundle sits somewhere an update can actually be written into.
//!
//! Three arrangements make the bundle unwritable, and none is fixable from inside the app:
//!
//! - App Translocation (Cmdr opened straight from `~/Downloads`, so Gatekeeper runs it from a
//!   randomized read-only mount) and a still-mounted `.dmg`. Both surface as `EROFS`, and a
//!   read-only mount refuses root too.
//! - A bundle this user may not write into, in practice one a `.pkg` installed as `root:wheel`.
//!   Admin rights don't fix that either: on macOS 13+, App Management refuses a privileged helper
//!   (`osascript … with administrator privileges` runs through Apple's `authtrampoline`, which
//!   isn't Cmdr's team) the same way it refuses everyone else. `DETAILS.md` § A bundle that can't
//!   be written.
//!
//! Detecting this BEFORE the download matters. Without the gate, such an install downloads ~63 MB
//! and rewrites nothing, once per poll interval, for as long as it runs.
