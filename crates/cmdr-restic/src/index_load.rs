//! Loading a repo's full index: one load per repo however many listings wait on
//! it, cancelled when the last of them leaves, with progress in real bytes.
//!
//! rustic's own load reads every index file in parallel on rayon's GLOBAL pool,
//! each read a pool worker blocked in our adapter for a whole NAS round trip
//! (Cmdr's search and icons share that pool), it can't be cancelled, and its
//! progress counts files. So the load reads the index files itself, on the async
//! runtime, counting bytes and checking the cancel between chunks, and streams
//! them to rustic through an [`IndexFeed`]: a bounded window, each file's bytes
//! dropped the moment rustic takes them, so the memory on top of rustic's own
//! stays the same at any index size. rustic decodes them on a small pool of the
//! load's own (`repo::on_own_pool`), never the global one.
