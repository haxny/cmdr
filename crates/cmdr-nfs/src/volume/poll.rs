//! Polling for changes: the one place this backend breaks "subscribe, don't
//! poll", because NFSv3 has nothing to subscribe to.
//!
//! One `GETATTR` per directory a pane shows on the volume, every
//! [`POLL_EVERY`], and a [`DirectoryChange::FullRefresh`] only when the
//! directory's `(mtime, ctime)` moved since the pane listed it: renaming,
//! adding, or removing a name inside a folder bumps both on every server.
//!
//! - ❗ **Nothing with no pane open on the volume, and nothing while it isn't
//!   `Connected`.** The store is asked which directories are shown
//!   (`ListingHost::open_listing_paths`, an in-memory read); an empty answer
//!   sends nothing, and the poller stops once it has stayed empty for a tick.
//!   A volume that's down sends nothing either: ❌ never a `GETATTR` on top of
//!   the reconnect backoff, which already decides when the server is asked.
//! - ❗ **One `GETATTR` per directory per tick, ❌ never per entry**, pipelined
//!   on the one connection. The handle comes from the cache the listing filled,
//!   so a steady tick costs no `LOOKUP`.
//! - **A change for a directory no pane shows any more is dropped**: the store
//!   is asked again after the round, and only what it still shows is reported.
//! - **The stamp a change is measured against is the LISTING's**, from its
//!   first page (`Nfs3Client::list_dir`), so a change between the listing and
//!   the next tick is never mistaken for the baseline.
//! - The round runs through `noting`, so a poll that finds the server gone is
//!   the detector when nobody else is asking: the pane hears it within the
//!   silence ladder, and the backoff takes over.
//!
//! `listing_watch_coverage` stays `None`: a poll can miss a change that comes
//! and goes inside one tick, so it can't vouch for a pre-flight.
