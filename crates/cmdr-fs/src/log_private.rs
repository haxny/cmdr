//! Mark the user-derived values in a log line, so an error report hashes exactly them.
//!
//! A log site that knows a value is a path, a name, a volume label, a host, or an account name
//! prints it through [`LogPrivate`] (`path={:?}` with `LogPrivate::dir_path(&path)`, or `{}` in
//! prose). That wraps the value between its kind's opener and [`CLOSER`], so the error reporter
//! hashes exactly that span instead of guessing where a name ends. The markers are Unicode
//! noncharacters from [`RESERVED`]: invisible in most viewers, never typed by a person, and still
//! valid scalar values, so a real file name CAN hold one. The reader of a marked line (the app's
//! `redact` module) treats every char of the range as structure and fails closed on anything it
//! can't pair. The table here and [`markers`] are the single source of truth both sides read;
//! nothing else lists the code points.
//!
//! A marked string is log text, never data: ❌ never turn a [`LogPrivate`] into a `String`, a
//! path, a stored value, or UI copy.

/// decode each span. A non-UTF-8 value prints lossily, the way `Path::display` does.

/// It borrows and writes straight into the `Formatter`, so it costs nothing on a record below the
