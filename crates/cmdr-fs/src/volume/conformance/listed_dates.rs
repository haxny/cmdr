//! What a volume's listings promise about dates: no entry carries a date its
//! volume doesn't claim through [`Volume::supported_dates`].

use std::path::Path;

use crate::volume::Volume;

/// No entry of `dir`'s listing, nor `get_metadata` of one, carries a creation
/// or added date that `volume.supported_dates(dir)` doesn't claim.
///
/// `dir` must already hold at least one entry, and the assertion checks that
/// first, so a fixture that seeded nothing can't pass by accident. Seed it the
/// way the backend fills dates (a real file on a real store), since what's
/// under test is the backend's own mapping.
///
/// **Why this one is worth a shared assertion.** A sort by Created or Added
/// orders rows only where the volume claims the date and falls back to
/// Modified elsewhere. A backend that fills a date it doesn't claim sorts by a
/// date the user never sees honored; one that claims less than it fills hides
/// a real date behind the fallback. The claim is a hand-written answer per
/// backend, and nothing but this keeps it in step with the mapping code.
