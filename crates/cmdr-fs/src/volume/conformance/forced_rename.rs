/// [`Volume::rename`] with `force == true` never takes a folder that still holds
/// something: it refuses, and both ends stay exactly as they were.
///
/// `dir` must be a directory holding at least one entry, and `from` must exist
/// (a file or a folder: callers run it with each). The assertion checks both
/// preconditions first.
///
/// **Why this one is worth a shared assertion.** `force` is the user's "replace
/// what's there", given in a dialog that compares two entries, never a tree. The
/// local kernel refuses this shape by itself (`EISDIR`, `ENOTEMPTY`), but the
/// verbs other backends reach for don't: WebDAV's `MOVE` with `Overwrite: T`
/// deletes the whole destination tree first (RFC 4918 § 9.9.3), and a shell's
/// `mv -f` onto a folder moves the source INTO it, replacing a same-named entry
/// inside. Either one turns a confirmed rename into a lost folder.
