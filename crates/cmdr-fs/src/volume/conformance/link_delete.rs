//! What [`Volume::delete`] and [`Volume::entry_kind`] promise about a symbolic
//! link to a folder: it's a leaf, and deleting it removes the link alone.

/// A symbolic link to a folder reads as a link ([`Volume::entry_kind`]), and
/// [`Volume::delete`] on it removes the LINK, with the folder it points at and
/// everything in it left exactly as they were.
///
/// `link` must already exist on `volume` as a symbolic link to the directory
/// `target`, which holds `child_name` directly inside it.
///
/// **Why this one is worth a shared assertion.** A recursive delete walks a
/// tree by asking what each entry is, and treats a link as a leaf: one
/// `delete` of the link itself. A backend whose `entry_kind` followed the link
/// would send the walker INTO the target, and one whose `delete` followed it
/// would refuse (`rmdir` on a link) or, worse, act on the target. Either way a
/// folder outside the selection is at stake (#505).
///
/// Backends with no links (MTP, S3, WebDAV, SMB) have nothing to run this
/// against.
