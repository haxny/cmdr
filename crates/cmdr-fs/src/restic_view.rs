//! Where a restic repo's snapshot view sits in a path, lexically.

//! The view is `<repo>/Browse snapshots`: a folder a pane shows inside a repo,
//! with no inode behind it. These are the naming questions about it, with no
//! I/O. They live here, not in `cmdr-restic`, so the listing engine and the
//! write guards can ask them without linking `rustic_core`, the same reason
//! `archive_format` holds the archive suffix test. `cmdr-restic` re-exports
//! both names; the confirm (is that folder really a repo?) stays there.
