//! A listing's word on a link, on a backend whose listings can't be trusted to
//! mark one ([`BackendKind::listings_mark_links`]).
//!
//! A Samba share lists a Unix symlink as the folder it points to, with no
//! `is_symlink`, so a walk that merges or descends on the listing alone acts
//! through the link: on its target's files, a folder the user never picked
//! (#613). There, a listed folder is a folder only once `Volume::entry_kind`
//! says so, one round trip per folder. Everywhere else the listing is the
//! answer and these cost nothing.
