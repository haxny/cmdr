//! The live transfer tree: a copy, move, or compress's selection as a tree,
//! with every folder's and file's progress, for the progress dialog and the
//! queue to show which folder is in flight, what landed, and what's next.
//!
//! The backend owns the whole model; a view asks for a window of flattened
//! rows (`view.rs`) and holds nothing but its own hand toggles. Drivers report
//! through `report.rs`. Map, budget, and decisions: `CLAUDE.md` and
//! `DETAILS.md` beside this file.
