//! How a staged write of generated output replaces a file at its name whole:
//! one atomic rename-with-force ([`StagedWrite::commit_atomic_replace`]), or,
//! on a backend without one, the original set aside, the temp renamed onto the
//! free name, and the aside discarded
//! ([`StagedWrite::commit_with_displaced_original`]). A fresh compress over an
//! existing archive publishes this way. Split out of `staged_write.rs`, beside
//! the landing every other staged write takes (`staged_write_landing.rs`).
//!
//! ❗ **Classify before acting**, as the landing does: a publish rename that
//! fails on the transport may have been performed by the server, so the
//! publish is cut off right there ([`PublishError::CutOff`]), the temp left
//! where it is and the aside still held. Deleting the temp on that error
//! reported a failure for an archive that had been published, and removed
//! nothing. The caller waits for the destination and then settles
//! ([`CutOffPublish::resume`]) or gives up ([`CutOffPublish::give_up`]).
