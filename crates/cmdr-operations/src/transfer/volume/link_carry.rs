//! Whether, and which, symlinks a COPY lands as symlinks on the destination.
//!
//! One value per copy, built before the scan: it answers for the sources the
//! person selected (their targets are read here, so the scan can count each as
//! the one leaf it is) and for the links a merge walk meets later. `DETAILS.md`
//! § "A copy carries a link as the link".
//!
//! A destination proves it can hold a link once per operation, on a tracked
//! temp, and only when a link actually turned up: the backend's
//! `Volume::can_hold_links` can't speak for the filesystem under it (exFAT on a
//! local volume), and that has to be known BEFORE a conflict is resolved, because
//! a link and what it points at clash differently.
//!
//! A move never builds one (`MergeCtx::links` stays `None`): it follows a link
//! on purpose (`../DETAILS.md` § "Symlinks are opaque to a move").
