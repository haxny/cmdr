//! The volume engines' half of `../../refused_name.rs`: turning a failure into
//! the question, for one item whose destination refused its name.
//!
//! Who asks is whoever may wait on a person: the merge WALKER for the leaves it
//! submitted (a leaf is a future only the walker polls, so it must never wait
//! on the dispatch mutex itself, `merge.rs::LeafPool`), and the top-level
//! dispatch for a source whose own name was refused (a spawned task in the
//! concurrent driver, the closure in the serial one). Each asks only about a
//! refusal AT the item it owns, so a deep refusal answered Stop doesn't get
//! asked about again on its way up.
