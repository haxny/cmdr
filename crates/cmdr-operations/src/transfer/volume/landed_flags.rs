//! The user flags a copied FILE puts on only after its landing rename: Locked
//! (and append-only) refuse that rename on local disk, and SMB's Read-only
//! makes a staged temp unremovable, so they can't ride the write the way the
//! rest of a file's metadata does (`Volume::write_from_stream` asks the stream
//! and puts it on the temp). The contract: `DETAILS.md` § "Copies keep the
//! source's metadata".
//!
//! The engine snapshots the set off the source stream before the write
//! consumes it ([`after_landing`]), a few bytes read off what the open already
//! holds, and spends one `Volume::apply_metadata` on the landed name only when
//! the set isn't empty ([`put_on`]): a plain file costs nothing, and so does a
//! Hidden-only file onto a destination whose write keeps Hidden itself (SMB's
//! `staged_flags`).
//!
//! One landing: `stream_pipe_file` lands every staged file, a safe-replace's
//! swap over the original included, and puts the set on right after, at the
//! file's final name.
