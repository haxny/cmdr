//! The destination an Overwrite is replacing, held aside until whatever replaces
//! it has landed.
//!
//! Three shapes reach it. A same-volume move replaces by RENAMING, so the new
//! bytes need no temp and the only thing at risk is the entry being replaced;
//! each such aside settles the moment its one rename answers. A file→file
//! Overwrite's landing (`WriteStaging::StageOverOriginal`, on a destination
//! without a one-step replace) sets the original aside for the staged temp to
//! take its name, and settles it the moment the temp lands
//! ([`DisplacedDestination::hold_for_swap`], driven by
//! `staged_write_landing.rs`). A cross-type Overwrite (a folder landing on a
//! file, or a file on a folder) lands leaf by leaf over the rest of the
//! operation, so those asides go to the operation's [`DisplacedLedger`] and
//! settle when it ends. The local-FS twin is
//! `crates/cmdr-operations/src/overwrite.rs::DisplacedEntry`.

/// delete an existing dest either), so the name has to be free first. Deleting
/// to free it is what makes the gap fatal: the replacing rename is a separate

/// a session blip fails it after the delete has already succeeded — the
/// destination gone, the source not moved. One rename aside costs one call on
/// every backend and turns that into a restore. A cross-type Overwrite has the
/// same gap, only wider: the folder replacing a file streams in over many calls,
/// any of which can fail or be cancelled.
///
