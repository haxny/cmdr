//! Giving the folders a cross-volume copy created their source folders' dates,
//! modification AND creation, and whatever else the source folder carries
//! (`Volume::folder_metadata`: an archive folder's AppleDouble xattrs), once
//! everything inside them has landed.
//!
//! Writing a child bumps its folder's date on every real store, so a folder can
//! only keep its source's date if it's set AFTER its last child: the merge walk
//! notes each folder it created as it leaves it (post-order), and the copy
//! stamps the whole list once the subtree's leaves have drained. A subtree that
//! failed or was cancelled is never stamped: a folder holding part of its
//! contents must not claim the date of the whole. The dates come from the
//! listing entry the walk already holds (the scan's stat for a top-level
//! folder), so they cost no round trip; the rest is one `folder_metadata` ask
//! per folder, which every backend but the archive answers empty with no I/O.
//! `DETAILS.md` § "Copies keep the source's metadata".
//!
//! A folder that arrives without a date its source had (the destination can't
//! hold it, or refused it) is counted for the loss note
//! (`crates/cmdr-operations/src/metadata_losses.rs`).
//!
//! ❌ Not the extract quarantine: a folder gets that the moment the walk creates
//! it (`extract_quarantine.rs`), since this pass skips every folder of a
//! cancelled subtree. A quarantine a SIDECAR carries is replaced by the
//! archive's here, so this pass never undoes that one.
