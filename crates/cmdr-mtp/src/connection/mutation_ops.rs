//! MTP mutation operations: delete, create folder, rename, and move.
//!
//! ## A cached handle is checked before it's acted on
//!
//! Delete, rename, and move address an object by a handle the path cache
//! holds, and a device that frees a handle may hand it to another object (MTP
//! 1.1 § 3.4.1 forbids that within a session; some firmware does it anyway, and
//! Android re-keys handles across a media rescan). So each one reads the
//! object's `ObjectInfo` under the same device-lock hold as the mutation, and
//! acts only when its name and parent are the path's ([`is_the_object_at`]).
//! On a mismatch nothing is touched: the path is forgotten and resolved once
//! more from a fresh listing ([`MtpConnectionManager::on_the_object_at`]), and
//! a second mismatch is `ObjectNotFound`.
