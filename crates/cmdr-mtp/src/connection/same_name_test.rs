//! Two siblings answering to one name.
//!
//! PTP lets a phone or camera hold two files with the same name in one folder.
//! ❗ Regression anchor for #523: the path cache kept the LAST twin, so a backup
//! read the second twin twice and never the first, and deleting row one deleted
//! the other file. Each twin's row now carries its own object, so every op on a
//! row reaches exactly that row's file, and only the shared name given alone (a
//! path with no row behind it) is refused.
//!
//! The virtual device is backed by a real folder, which can't hold twins, so
//! `testing::make_twins` has `report.txt` answer to `notes.txt` too. Its backing
//! file keeps its own name, which is how a cell tells which object an op hit.
