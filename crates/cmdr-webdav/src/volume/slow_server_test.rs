//! A server that's SLOW is not a server that's gone, and the silence watch
//! tells them apart (`cmdr_fs::volume::liveness`).
//!
//! These cells need a server that answers one request while it holds another,
//! trickles a body a byte at a time, or goes quiet on command, so they bring
//! their own: [`FakeDav`]. The silence ladder is shortened (`fake_dav::SHORT`)
//! so they run in real time; the production-length ladder is `cmdr-fs`'s
//! `volume/liveness_test.rs` (paused clock) and `connection_drop_test.rs` (a
//! real server behind a black-holed proxy).
