//! What keeps something alive while a pane shows a directory.
//!
//! A [`ListingObserver`] hears one call when a listing enters the listing cache
//! and one when it leaves, in registration order. Cmdr's observers and their
//! order: the app's `listing_host/DETAILS.md` § "The observers".
//!
//! **Arming belongs to the BACKEND, ❌ never to a frontend subscription**:
//! `host/DETAILS.md` § "Observers".
//!
//! The host hands its observers to the engine's builder, in order
//! (`ListingsBuilder::observer`).
