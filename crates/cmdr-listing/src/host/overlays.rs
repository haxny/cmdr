//! Rows a PANE shows that no volume holds.
//!
//! A [`ListingOverlay`] contributes extra [`FileEntry`]s to one directory's
//! listing, folded in by the listing pipeline after the volume's own entries
//! arrive. Cmdr's contributors are the virtual `.git` portal, which puts the six
//! category rows (`branches/`, `tags/`, …) into a repo's `.git/` listing, and
//! restic, which puts a `Browse snapshots` row into a backup repo's folder.
//! Every real entry beside them stays the volume's, editable and deletable as
//! always.
//!
//! ❌ **Never move this into a `Volume` impl**: a contributed row must reach a
//! pane and nothing else, which is also why a decorated listing never answers
//! the fresh-listing oracle. Why: `host/DETAILS.md` § "Overlays".
//!
//! The host hands its contributors to the engine's builder, in order
//! (`ListingsBuilder::overlay`), and the read pipeline (`pipeline.rs`) folds
//! over whatever the engine holds, between the enrich and the sort, on every
//! read that builds or replaces a listing.
