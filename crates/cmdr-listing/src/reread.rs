//! What a host's change watch asks the engine once it heard something: a full
//! re-read of one listing ([`refresh`], or [`begin_read`] + [`refresh_from_entries`]
//! when the host reads the directory itself), or an incremental patch of the
//! children it re-stat'd ([`observe_children`]). The `Listings` methods are in
//! `engine/reread.rs`.
//!
//! [`refresh`]: super::Listings::refresh
//! [`begin_read`]: super::Listings::begin_read
//! [`refresh_from_entries`]: super::Listings::refresh_from_entries
//! [`observe_children`]: super::Listings::observe_children
//!
//! The OS half (debouncing, rebasing event paths, the stat, when to fall back to
//! a full re-read, telling the pane its directory is gone) stays with the host.
//!
//! **No full re-read lands after a newer one did.** Every full re-read (this
//! file's two, a `FullRefresh`, a respell, a backend's `Replaced`) takes a
//! [`ReadGeneration`] when it STARTS reading, and [`Inner::update_listing_entries`],
//! the one step that stores a re-read, drops it under the cache write lock when
//! the listing already published a newer one. Incremental patches take none and
//! bump none: a re-read that started before a patch can still land after it and
//! carry the older state, since bumping would drop every re-read during a busy
//! burst. `DETAILS.md` § "Read generations".
