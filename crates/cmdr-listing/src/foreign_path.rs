//! Opening a directory by a path that may not be its volume's own spelling.
//!
//! A pane's path usually came out of a listing, so it's the volume's exact
//! spelling. One that didn't (typed, pasted, a restored tab, a favorite, an MCP
//! `nav_to_path`, or a pane carried over from the macOS kernel mount, which
//! decomposes every name) misses on a backend that matches names byte-for-byte
//! (SMB, ERR-VETBX). So a pane listing asks as given and, only on `NotFound`,
//! asks the volume where that path is stored (`Volume::find_stored_spelling`)
//! and lists THAT. The listing then carries the stored spelling: its cache key,
//! its watcher key, and every child path are the volume's own bytes, and the
//! pane adopts the spelling from `listing-complete`.
//!
//! Paths from outside Cmdr that name FILES (a Finder drag-in, a paste of files
//! copied in Finder) are respelled once where they enter, by
//! [`stored_spellings`], before any operation sees them.
//!
//! ❌ Only at those two seams. A delete walker, a copy scan, or a refresh lists
//! paths that came out of a listing, and there a miss means the directory is
//! gone: resolving it could hand the walker a look-alike twin.
