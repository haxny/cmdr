//! [`GitPortalVolume`]: a read-only [`Volume`] over one repo's virtual `.git`
//! trees.
//!
//! The same shape `ArchiveVolume` has. A path crossing `.git/<category>/` isn't
//! a hook inside the local backend: `VolumeManager::resolve` routes it here, and
//! this volume maps the whole input path to `(repo, category, ref, tree path)`
//! through [`path::classify_in`], so `ResolvedVolume.path` stays the caller's
//! path verbatim.
//!
//! ## What it serves, and what it doesn't
//!
//! Its namespace is the SIX virtual categories and everything under them.
//! `root()` is `<worktree>/.git`, and listing that root answers the six category
//! rows alone: the real `.git/*` entries (`HEAD`, `config`, `hooks/`) are the
//! parent volume's, stay writable there, and reach the pane through the listing
//! overlay rather than through here. Anything else — `.git/config`,
//! `.git/objects/…`, a `.git` that isn't a repository at all — is `NotFound`,
//! because this volume genuinely doesn't hold it.
//!
//! ## Read-only by construction
//!
//! `is_writable()` is false and every mutation keeps the trait's `NotSupported`
//! default, so nothing has to remember a guard: a git tree is a snapshot of
//! objects, and the way to change one is `git` in a terminal. It can't watch
//! either (`can_watch_listings()` false, `listing_watch_coverage` `None`): the
//! paths don't exist on disk, so `notify` has nothing to arm on. Invalidation
//! comes from the per-repo `.git/*` watcher (`watcher.rs`) instead.
