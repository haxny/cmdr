/// it can be spawned fire-and-forget with no captured manager.

/// Shared by the triggers that all mean "roll forward from the visible scanner,
/// not the invisible reconcile": the cold-start replay full-scan fallback
/// (`start_replay`), a live loop's ingestion backlog ([`after_live_loop`]), and
/// the shallow-`MustScanSubDirs` scanner routing
/// (`reconcile/reconciler/rescan/mod.rs`). Single-flight: `start_scan` no-ops if a
/// scan is already running, so overlapping triggers coalesce.
///
/// Runs the blocking `start_scan` prelude off the lock (holding it across
/// `flush_blocking` + the space-info query would freeze every concurrent registry
/// user; the freshness firing inside `start_scan` would also re-lock the registry,
/// now fired through the manager's own `Arc`). Mirrors `state::force_scan`'s
/// extract-drop-run-reinsert flow.
